# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

# AGENTS

This file tracks the agent's thoughts, ideas, and work flow for the `things-fastmcp` repository.

## Instructions
- Append a new entry under `## Log` for each change made.
- Briefly describe the reasoning behind significant decisions.
- Run `ruff check .` and `pytest` after modifications.

## Log
### 2025-10-31
- **Fixed STDIO transport compatibility for Claude Desktop**
  - Changed default transport from `streamable-http` to `stdio` in fast_server.py
  - Added THINGS_MCP_TRANSPORT environment variable to allow HTTP transport when needed
  - HTTP transport (streamable-http) now only used when explicitly requested
  - Updated README with correct configuration for all MCP clients (Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf)
  - Replaced hardcoded paths with `{{ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_THINGS_FASTMCP}}` placeholder
  - Added troubleshooting section and quick setup commands for fish/bash shells
  - Resolved relative import errors by using proper `uv run server` command instead of `fastmcp run`

### 2025-10-16
- **Completed and archived OpenSpec change `remove-legacy-mcp` - Consolidated to FastMCP-only implementation (v2.0.0)**
  - Deleted 5 legacy files: things_server.py, simple_server.py, simple_url_scheme.py, mcp_tools.py, and src/things_mcp/things_server.py
  - Updated pyproject.toml, smithery.yaml, and __init__.py to version 2.0.0
  - Updated README.md: removed Migration & Deprecation section, added concise Version 2.0 Changes section
  - Created comprehensive CHANGELOG.md entry for 2.0.0 with breaking changes and migration guide
  - Maintained all 19 MCP tool APIs - full backward compatibility at tool level
  - Removed ~714 lines of duplicate code, simplified maintenance
  - Archived to openspec/changes/archive/2025-10-16-remove-legacy-mcp/
- Created OpenSpec change proposal `remove-legacy-mcp` for consolidating to FastMCP-only implementation
  - Comprehensive proposal.md documenting why (dual-implementation burden), what (remove 5 legacy files), and impact (breaking change → v2.0.0)
  - Detailed tasks.md with 8 implementation phases: pre-flight checks, code removal, import cleanup, config updates, documentation, testing, versioning, validation
  - Design.md with technical decisions, migration plan, risks/mitigations, rollback strategy
  - No spec deltas needed (implementation consolidation maintains all 19 tool APIs)
- Created comprehensive openspec/project.md with full project context (purpose, tech stack, conventions, domain knowledge, constraints, dependencies)
- Cleaned up and improved README.md based on openspec structure:
  - Enhanced overview and key benefits section
  - Added prerequisites section upfront
  - Better organized features by category (Things 3 Integration, Reliability, MCP)
  - Complete inventory of all 19 MCP tools with descriptions
  - Added architecture diagram and data flow
  - New sections: Usage with AI Assistants, Code Quality, Troubleshooting, Migration & Deprecation
  - Fixed all 44 markdown linting errors
- Removed redundant documentation files:
  - Deleted RELEASE_NOTES.md (redundant with CHANGELOG.md)
  - Deleted IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (covered by openspec/project.md, README.md, and AGENTS.md)
- Updated smithery.yaml to align with improved documentation:
  - Refreshed descriptions to match new README
  - Added all 19 tools (was only 10)
  - Added THINGS_FASTMCP_HOST and THINGS_FASTMCP_PORT config options
  - Updated tags for better discoverability

### 2025-10-11
- Added shared MCP error helper returning `CallToolResult` and updated tool handlers to use it for failure cases.

### 2025-10-11
- Added MCP tool annotations across registration and Fast/Simple server implementations to align with MCP metadata expectations.

### 2025-10-11
- Added CLI flags and env var validation to the run script so operators can easily bind to alternate hosts and ports without manual exports.
- Extended FastMCP server binding logic and README guidance to document the new port override support.
### 2025-10-10
- Added FastMCP constructor introspection for icon support and guarded icon metadata so older runtimes still launch cleanly.

### 2025-10-09
- Added compatibility helper so FastMCP icon metadata works whether or not `mcp.types.Icon` is available in the runtime.
- Guarded FastMCP server construction so `website_url` metadata is only passed when supported by the installed MCP version.

### 2025-10-07
- Implemented logging redaction across handlers and the AppleScript bridge so user task content stays out of logs.
- Removed duplicate binding announcements from the CLI entrypoint so runtime logging only happens once and cached the binding helper for reuse.
- Clarified binding logs and helper exports so launchers surface localhost default without double logging.
- Switched FastMCP server default bind address to localhost with env override and documented exposure steps.
- Added FastMCP metadata (instructions, website, icon) constants and wired them into the server instantiation.
- Documented the surfaced assistant guidance in the README to mirror the MCP experience.
- Converted MCP icon metadata to use `mcp.types.Icon` objects to satisfy FastMCP validation.

### 2025-09-01
- Added `run_things_fastmcp.sh` helper script and integrated Rich logging.
- Documented macOS limitations preventing Docker usage for opening scripts.
- Introduced this AGENTS.md to record ongoing work.

### 2025-09-01
- Updated run script to bootstrap a uv-managed virtual environment or fall back to system Python.
- Clarified Quick Start docs about the helper script's environment handling.

### 2025-10-07
- Added standalone privacy and terms documents so operators understand local data handling and policy expectations.
- Updated README to link to the new policies and prompt users to review them before setup, keeping onboarding aligned with compliance guidance.
